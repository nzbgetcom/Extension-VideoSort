# Sort movies and tv shows.
#
# This is a script for downloaded TV shows and movies. It uses scene-standard
# naming conventions to match TV shows and movies and rename/move/sort/organize
# them as you like.
#
# The script relies on python library "guessit" (http://guessit.readthedocs.org)
# to extract information from file names and includes portions of code from
# "SABnzbd+" (http://sabnzbd.org).
